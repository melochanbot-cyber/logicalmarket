    "commentary": "Global equities pushed higher as U.S.-Iran diplomatic progress lifted risk appetite \u2014 the Dow gained ground with tech stocks leading, while the dollar firmed on the d\u00e9tente narrative. Bitcoin flatlined at $67,132 (essentially unchanged on 24h) and ETH held $1,973 (+0.4%) as crypto traded in a tight overnight range with no fresh catalysts. Gold remains pinned below $5,000 as the stronger dollar and easing geopolitical fears sap safe-haven demand, though analysts maintain the pullback is corrective. The session's tone is cautiously constructive heading into Wednesday's full trading day, with the \"sell America\" contrarian call providing the only counterweight to the broad risk-on tilt.",
