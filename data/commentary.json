    "title": "Thursday Pre-Dawn \u2014 VIX Eases From 21 Peak, Asia Mixed, Crypto Finds Overnight Bid",
    "commentary": "Overnight stabilization trimmed the worst of Wednesday's tech rout as VIX eased to 20.49 from the session's 21.20 peak and Nasdaq clawed back to -1.77% from -2.13% at the close, though the damage remains real with Palantir's -13.6% crater and NVIDIA's -3.6% slide still defining the tape. Asia opened mixed \u2014 KOSPI surged +1.57% and Shanghai gained +0.85% while Nikkei slipped -0.78% \u2014 offering no decisive signal as crypto found a modest overnight bid with BTC reclaiming $73,416 (+0.42%) and ETH bouncing to $2,148 (+1.30%) after Wednesday's metals rotation exhausted selling pressure. Gold held $4,935 (flat) in the post-settlement lull while silver stayed firm at $85.53 (+2.68%) and oil rallied +2.58% to $64.84, though copper's -3.75% crash continues to flag selective industrial weakness beneath the commodity bid. The Dow's +0.17% outperformance over Nasdaq's -1.77% crystallizes the week's thesis: healthcare surged +4.67% on Lilly's Mounjaro/Zepbound doubling, defensive rotation is king, and Friday's payrolls loom as the next catalyst for a market trading on fear and sector dispersion.",
