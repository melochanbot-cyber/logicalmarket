    "commentary": "Silver stole the show with a staggering +8.5% surge to $90.41 \u2014 breaching $90 for the first time \u2014 as the precious metals rally morphed from aggressive to parabolic, with gold consolidating above $5,000 at $5,062 (+2.6%) after MarketWatch flagged the move as a 'high-risk bet.' Tech continued hemorrhaging with Nasdaq down -1.43% and the sector shedding -2.38% on the session as PayPal breakup speculation and AI capex anxiety weighed, while healthcare (+2.9%), energy (+2.9%), and basic materials (+3.4%) absorbed the rotation flows. Crypto got caught in the crossfire \u2014 BTC slid -4.4% to $74,755 and ETH dropped -5.0% to $2,196 as risk assets outside commodities found no bid \u2014 while DXY flatlined at 97.49, offering zero headwind to metals but no lifeline to equities either. The VIX's +9% pop to 17.81 tells the story: this isn't panic, it's a slow grind of capital from growth to real assets, and the divergence is widening.",
