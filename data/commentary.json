    "commentary": "Precious metals went parabolic Tuesday — silver exploded 15.5% to $88.94 and gold surged 6.8% to $4,970, their most violent session in years, as a weakening dollar (DXY -0.09% to 97.54) and safe-haven flows collided with short-squeeze mechanics across the metals complex. Asia roared: KOSPI +6.84%, Nikkei +3.92%, Sensex +2.54%, while U.S. futures pointed higher with Dow +1.05% to 49,408, S&P +0.54% to 6,976, and Nasdaq +0.56% buoyed by Palantir-led tech optimism and a packed earnings slate. Copper joined the commodities rally at +4.27%, basic materials led U.S. sectors at +5.7%, and the VIX cratered another 7.3% to 16.16 — risk appetite remains insatiable despite Pfizer's post-earnings dive dragging healthcare down 4%. Crypto treaded water with BTC flat at $78,244 and ETH +0.8% at $2,310, sidelined as capital chased the metals breakout.",
