Dollar index slipped further to 96.80 after weak December retail sales sealed the deal on a more dovish Fed \u2014 markets now pricing three rate cuts in 2026 versus two a week ago, with China's Treasury warning adding fuel to the fire. Precious metals remained under pressure with silver extending its brutal correction (-2.56% to $81.23), now down over $40 from its late-January $121 peak, while gold held near $5,028 (-0.62%) defending the psychological floor. Equities treading water into CPI \u2014 S&P 500 flat at 6,963, Dow edging to fresh records \u2014 as the inflation print will either validate or demolish the rate cut narrative.",
