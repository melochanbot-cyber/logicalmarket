President Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as Fed chair — perceived as hawkish — triggered a DXY reversal from its 95.34 multi-year low, pressuring risk assets broadly. Crude oil was the lone standout, surging on Middle East supply fears, while the U.S. government entered a partial shutdown heading into the weekend.",

The selloff was triggered by CME Group announcing up to 50% margin requirement hikes on gold and silver futures starting Monday, combined with the hawkish signal of Warsh's Fed nomination.
