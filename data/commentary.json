    "commentary": "Risk-off intensified into the close as a surprise uptick in jobless claims compounded Alphabet's earnings miss, deepening the tech-led sell-off with S&P 500 finishing -0.57% and Nasdaq -0.55% while VIX surged 12.5% past the 21 handle. Silver's spectacular unwind accelerated to -9.78% at $76.14 \u2014 now down over $14 from yesterday's $90 euphoria \u2014 dragging gold down -1.39% to $4,882 and oil -2.61% to $63.44 in a broad commodities liquidation that shows no sign of finding a floor. Bitcoin plunged -7.3% to $69,333, breaching the $70K support convincingly with Stifel now warning of a potential drop to $38K, while ETH shed -6.6% to $2,046 \u2014 the crypto liquidation cascade is feeding on itself as overleveraged longs from the metals-to-crypto rotation unwind. The DXY barely budged at 97.72 (+0.10%), confirming this isn't a dollar-strength story but a pure deleveraging flush ahead of Friday's payrolls, which now carry even more weight with the labor market suddenly looking shaky.",
