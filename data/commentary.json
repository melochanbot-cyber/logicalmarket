    "commentary": "Wall Street closed Monday's session firmly in the green \u2014 Dow +1.09% to 49,423, S&P 500 +0.57% to 6,979, Nasdaq +0.58% \u2014 as the VIX slid 4.8% to 16.61, signaling complacency heading into a stacked earnings week. The energy complex was a bloodbath: crude oil plunged 4.6% to $62.19 and natural gas posted a historic -25.2% single-day collapse to $3.26, the worst session in recent memory driven by warmer weather forecasts and oversupply fears. Silver bucked the metals trend, rallying 2.0% to $80.14 while gold retreated 1.1% to $4,691 on continued margin-hike fallout; crypto held quiet bids with BTC +1.1% at $77,966 and ETH flat at $2,322. The dollar firmed 0.65% to 97.62 as traders brace for Friday's January payrolls and a mega-cap earnings gauntlet featuring Alphabet, Amazon, AMD, and Disney.",
