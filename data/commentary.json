Silver's spectacular unwind continued with a -9.8% plunge to $76.12, now down $14 from Tuesday's $90 euphoria, dragging gold -1.03% to $4,900 and oil -2.69% to $63.39 as the entire commodity complex buckled under forced liquidation and rising jobless claims stoked labor market fears. Bitcoin crashed to $68,146 (-7.3%), its lowest since October 2024 with Stifel now warning of a potential drop to $38K, while ETH broke below $2K at $1,995 (-6.2%) — the crypto rout feeding on itself as OpenAI's Frontier agent platform launch added fresh pressure to software names and risk assets found zero safe haven ahead of Friday's critical payrolls report.",

AMD's -17.3% earnings-day bloodbath and Palantir's -11.6% continued slide kept Nasdaq pinned at -1.51% while the Dow diverged yet again at +0.53%, extending the value-over-growth rotation that Goldman flagged as producing winners' worst day in six years. Crypto joined the liquidation cascade with BTC plunging 7.0% to $69,525 — breaking below $70K for the first time this week — and ETH sliding 6.4% to $2,054, as risk assets broadly repriced with VIX surging 15.5% to 20.79.

    "commentary": "A late-session bid cut the worst of the tech rout as Nasdaq trimmed losses to -1.11% from midday's -1.77% trough and S&P 500 clawed back to -0.19% while the Dow extended gains to +0.67%, confirming the defensive rotation thesis with investors pouring into value, healthcare, and industrials at the expense of megacap growth — a pattern MarketWatch flagged as the defining trade of this cycle. VIX eased from 20.49 to 19.36, still elevated but no longer screaming panic, as the fear gauge's retreat from the 21-handle suggests the afternoon recovery has legs even if the underlying tech damage (Palantir -13.6%, NVIDIA bleeding) remains unresolved heading into tomorrow's payrolls. Commodities stayed hot with silver surging +3.55% to $86.25, NatGas ripping +5.13%, and oil firming +2.74% to $64.94, while copper's -3.51% crash continues to flash yellow on industrial demand — the metals complex is pricing in geopolitical premium and dollar weakness, not a broad growth impulse.

Gold held $4,935 (flat) in the post-settlement lull while silver stayed firm at $85.53 (+2.68%) and oil rallied +2.58% to $64.84, though copper's -3.75% crash continues to flag selective industrial weakness beneath the commodity bid.

    "title": "Wednesday Late — AMD Craters -12%, Gold Holds $5K, Silver Parabola Intact at $89",
    "commentary": "Dow diverged from tech once again as surprise ADP jobs data bolstered old-economy names (+0.35%) while Nasdaq bled -0.45% on AMD's post-earnings -12% implosion and AppLovin's -13.7% gutting — Google earnings loom after the bell as the arbiter of whether AI capex anxiety claims another victim. Gold teased $5,060 intraday (+2.5%) and silver continued its parabolic $89 run (+7%), with precious metals mania now so entrenched that even a flat DXY at 97.51 can't slow the bid. Crypto stayed on the ropes with BTC at $74,392 (-4%) and ETH at $2,178 (-3.5%), still bleeding from the rotation into hard assets that's defined February's opening sessions. SMCI surged +14.8% on AI infrastructure optimism, a rare bright spot in a tape where the gulf between metals euphoria and digital asset malaise widens by the hour.",
