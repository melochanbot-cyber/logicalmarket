    "commentary": "Silver's parabolic rally detonated spectacularly \u2014 crashing 10.36% to $75.65 from yesterday's $90 euphoria \u2014 dragging gold down 1.93% to $4,855 as the precious metals mania that defined the week reversed with brutal speed, vindicating the 'high-risk bet' warnings. AMD's -17.3% earnings-day bloodbath and Palantir's -11.6% continued slide kept Nasdaq pinned at -1.51% while the Dow diverged yet again at +0.53%, extending the value-over-growth rotation that Goldman flagged as producing winners' worst day in six years. Crypto joined the liquidation cascade with BTC plunging 7.0% to $69,525 \u2014 breaking below $70K for the first time this week \u2014 and ETH sliding 6.4% to $2,054, as risk assets broadly repriced with VIX surging 15.5% to 20.79. Oil dropped 2.76% to $63.34 amid the broad commodity unwind, while the DXY held flat at 97.70 \u2014 this isn't dollar strength killing assets, it's a pure positioning flush after an overextended week of metals euphoria and tech destruction.",

    "commentary": "A late-session bid cut the worst of the tech rout as Nasdaq trimmed losses to -1.11% from midday's -1.77% trough and S&P 500 clawed back to -0.19% while the Dow extended gains to +0.67%, confirming the defensive rotation thesis with investors pouring into value, healthcare, and industrials at the expense of megacap growth \u2014 a pattern MarketWatch flagged as the defining trade of this cycle.
