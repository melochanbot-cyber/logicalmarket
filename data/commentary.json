Gold slipped below the psychological $5,000 level to close at exactly $5,000 (-0.19%), offering the bulls a crucial test after this week's historic run. Oil continued defying gravity at $66.53 (+2.3%) on persistent supply fears while crypto staged a modest overnight recovery \u2014 Bitcoin rallied back to $66,927 (+0.9% on 24h), though Ethereum lagged at $1,937 (-0.8%). The close sets up a pivotal Friday with gold defending the $5K handle and equities searching for direction after two days of chop.",
