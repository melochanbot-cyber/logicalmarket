    "commentary": "Markets stabilized as the House passed a funding bill to end the government shutdown, injecting a rare dose of certainty — VIX eased to 18.32 (+12.1%) after breaching 19 earlier, though fear remains elevated with Nasdaq absorbing a -1.45% session and PayPal's -20% implosion now the defining single-stock story. Precious metals consolidated their extraordinary run with gold holding $4,973 (+6.9%) and silver at $84.95 (+10.3%) — moves MarketWatch called 'memelike' — while oil firmed to $64.10 (+3.2%) as the commodity complex stayed bid. Crypto staged a partial recovery from overnight lows: BTC reclaimed $76,332 (-2.1%) after touching $74,920 and ETH bounced to $2,294 (-1.1%), both clawing back from the risk-off contagion that hit digital assets hardest in the Asia session. DXY drifted lower at 97.39 (-0.25%), offering no resistance to the metals bid as traders now eye Friday's January payrolls for the next directional catalyst.",
