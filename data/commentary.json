    "commentary": "Crude oil gave back last week's Iran-driven gains with a brutal 5% drop to $61.98 as Bandar Abbas fears faded and demand concerns resurfaced, while natural gas cratered 18% \u2014 the day's biggest casualty. Tech led equities lower with Nasdaq down 0.94% as Nvidia's potentially smaller OpenAI stake and Europe's emerging 'kill switch' for U.S. tech platforms rattled sentiment; the VIX spiked 11% to 18.75. Bitcoin clung to $78,176 in a fragile holding pattern below the psychologically critical $80K level, while silver staged a 3.6% dead-cat bounce from Friday's historic crash. The dollar continued firming at 97.39 as the Warsh-as-Fed-chair trade consolidated \u2014 Morgan Stanley calling it a 'market stabilizing mechanism' even as everything else wobbled.",

    "commentary": "A brutal week across asset classes as precious metals suffered a historic unwind, crypto extended losses on thin weekend liquidity, and geopolitical risks escalated with an explosion at Iran's Bandar Abbas port. President Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as Fed chair \u2014 perceived as hawkish \u2014 triggered a DXY reversal from its 95.34 multi-year low, pressuring risk assets broadly. Crude oil was the lone standout, surging on Middle East supply fears, while the U.S. government entered a partial shutdown heading into the weekend.",

    "commentary": "Gold has stabilized at $5,067 after a harrowing 12% intraday plunge on Friday that took it from Thursday's record $5,600 down to $4,718. The selloff was triggered by CME Group announcing up to 50% margin requirement hikes on gold and silver futures starting Monday, combined with the hawkish signal of Warsh's Fed nomination. The partial recovery suggests dip-buyers are still present, but the precedent of a $900 intraday range will keep volatility elevated.",

Hedge funds had already cut net-long positions by 36% to a 23-month low in the week ending Jan. 27, and CME's margin hike announcement accelerated the unwind.

While Iranian authorities said the cause remains under investigation, the incident amplified already elevated tensions between Tehran and Washington amid fresh U.S. arms sales to Israel and Saudi Arabia. Supply disruption risk is now the dominant driver, with traders watching for any escalation that could threaten Hormuz transit.",
