    "title": "Saturday 2AM SGT \u2014 Risk Rally Extends: Dow Crosses 50K Barrier, BTC Reclaims $71K, VIX Crushed -17%",
    "commentary": "The week-ending relief rally carried through Friday with all US indices closing firmly green \u2014 Dow surging +2.16% to break above the psychological 50,000 level at 49,967 (tantalizingly close), S&P 500 +1.70%, Nasdaq +1.95%, Russell 2000 leading at +3.17% as small caps caught the risk-on wave. VIX collapsed -17.4% to 17.99, completely erasing Thursday's fear spike and signaling capitulation in volatility sellers as the week's deleveraging appears fully washed out. Crypto extended gains in weekend trading with BTC pushing to $70,881 (+6.3%) firmly reclaiming the $70K handle, ETH +5.5% at $2,070, while XRP ripped +18.6% on altcoin momentum. Gold held above $4,979 (+1.8%) with oil firming at $64.19 (+1.4%), though silver lagged at -0.25% \u2014 the commodity complex stabilizing after the week's spectacular volatility as DXY eased to 97.61 and markets head into the weekend cautiously optimistic.",
