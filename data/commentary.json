    "commentary": "The payrolls hangover hit hard as all three major indices closed uniformly red \u2014 Nasdaq -1.59%, S&P 500 -1.23%, Dow -1.20% \u2014 with VIX surging 7.6% back above 20 as Friday's jobs data failed to calm a market already bruised by the week's tech rout and commodities unwind. Gold staged a relief rally to $4,954 (+1.33%), bouncing off Thursday's $4,821 capitulation low, though silver continued its brutal mean reversion at $75.32 (-1.81%) \u2014 now down $15 from Tuesday's $90 euphoria in four sessions. Crypto found no respite with BTC sliding to $67,450 (-2.72%) and ETH crashing through $2K to $1,955 (-4.72%), extending the week's digital asset rout as deleveraging cascaded through overleveraged positions. Europe diverged sharply with DAX +0.49% and STOXX 50 +0.67%, while Asia showed mixed signals \u2014 Nikkei +0.81% but Hang Seng -1.21% \u2014 as global markets closed the week fragmented, defensive, and bracing for more volatility ahead.",
