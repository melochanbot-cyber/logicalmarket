Gold pushed further into record territory at $5,017, shrugging off a firmer dollar (DXY 98.03, +0.3%) in a move that continues to confound traditional macro playbooks. Crude held above $66 (+2.1%) on persistent supply-side jitters while crypto stabilized modestly \u2014 Bitcoin recovered to $66,441 (-1.0% on 24h) after yesterday's sharp selloff. The tone is cautious with jobless claims data in focus and the hard-asset bid remaining the dominant theme of the week.",
